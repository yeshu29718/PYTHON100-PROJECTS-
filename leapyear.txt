
1.
Identify the year you want to check.
Calculating leap years requires having a year that you want to check.
Use a past year, the current year, or a future year as your starting point.[1]
For example, you could start by checking 1997 or 2012 if you want to look at a past year,
or go with 2019 to check the current year, or select 2025 or 2028 to check a future year.
2.
See if the number is evenly divisible by 4.
Dividing the year by 4 will result in a whole number with no remainder if the number is evenly divisible.
The number must be evenly divisible by 4! Otherwise, it is not a leap year.[2]
3.
Confirm the number isn't evenly divisible by 100.
If a year is evenly divisible by 4, but it is not evenly divisible 100, then it is a leap year.
If a year is divisible by both 4 and 100, then it might not be a leap year,
and you will have to perform 1 more calculation to check.[3]
4.
Check if the number is evenly divisible by 400 to confirm a leap year.
If a year is divisible by 100, but not 400, then it is not a leap year.
If a year is divisible by both 100 and 400, then it is a leap year.[4]
